== Description ==

This plugin uses the [reegle Tagging
API](http://www.reeep.org/reegle-tagging-api) to suggest tags for your
posts. The tags are displayed in a word cloud, with the most relevant tags
appearing larger.

The plugin is based on [Thoth's Suggested Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/thoth-suggested-tags/)
